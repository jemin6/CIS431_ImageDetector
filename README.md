### History of group: 
Founded in 2018, Team-Image is composed of several [contributors](https://github.com/jemin6/CIS431_Image_Detector/wiki/Contributors)

When you watched some types of video, and want to find out certain types of object that showed inside the video, our app is the best way to do it. 

Our team developed this "Image detecting" application which allows you to track the time for each specific objects. 

We provide modules that you can use to set which object you want to detect. You just need to input which video you want to use and which object you want to detect, then our application will spit out the output for you 

The informations you can get from our product are the time (how long the object showed inside the video) and each frames (tells which frames the object showed).
